You can play it by using a [real skateboard wih an M5Stack](m5stack), if you connect it to your PC (Port 16, hardcoded atm. sorry...)

## How
Vertex Wave is written in C# with MonoGame and supports the Oculus Rift HMD on Windows.
The world is procedurally generated with voxels.

## Contribution
World genertion could be faster and also the game is sometimes a bit laggy.
If you know how to fix this, feel free to contribute.
