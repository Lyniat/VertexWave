# Vertex Wave

## About
Vertex Wave is an 80 style VR game where you have to surf on your keyboard through the Vertex Wave Network.

## How
Vertex Wave is written in C# with MonoGame and supports the Oculus Rift HMD on Windows.
The world is procedurally generated with voxels.

## Contribution
World genertion could be faster and also the game is sometimes a bit laggy.
If you know how to fix this, feel free to contribute.
